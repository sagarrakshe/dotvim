## ~/.vimrc configuration

I have been using vim since 3-4 years but never used even basic features in it. But recently i played lot with vim and tweaked for my needs. This is a small attempt for awesome `vimrc` plugin. 

## Installation:

It's pretty simple to install. Clone the repo and execute the `install.sh` file from it. It takes backup of your existing `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc` files(`~/.vimrc` and `~/.gvimrc`). In case you need to switch back to your original, just remap those original files.
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/sagarrakshe/dotvim ~/.vim
    $ cd .vim
    $ ./install.sh

## Color-Themes

It contains about 450+ color themes. Choose yours!
